# Mini-Stealthburner-Umbilical-ADXL-Mount
ADXL/PIS mount for MiniStealthburner on Voron V0.2 R1

There was no convinient way to mount my Fysetc Portable Input shaper.
<br />

Replace umbilical PCB mount upper mounting screws with M3x35
<br />
If you plan running your printer with this mount attached, consider printing it with ABS or ASA since the chamber can reach 60Â°C
<br /> 

Added ADXL mounting option, but is not tested, since I got no generic ADXL accelerometer :-)

Feel free to remix this mount to suit your desired accelerometer - step file attached.
